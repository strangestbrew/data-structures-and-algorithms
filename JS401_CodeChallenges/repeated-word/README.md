## Challenge Description
Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
Given a string of indeterminate length, tokenize the string, store it in a Hashmap, traverse the string, and then check the duplicated word count against the stored Hashmap values. 

Given the length of the string is indeterminate: 
Big O Time: O(N)
Bit O Space: O(N)
