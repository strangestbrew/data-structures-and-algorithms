# Challenge Summary
Find Maximum Value, Binary Tree 

## Challenge Description
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
Given a binary tree, traverse recursively and determine largest numeric value. Compare values as you move through the tree, returning the largest. 

Given the length of the string is indeterminate: 
Big O Time: O(N)
Bit O Space: O(N)
